            <description><![CDATA[<p>Context&#39;s Intelligence and Response teams have seen DLL Search Order being abused as a means of conducting network intrusions in real environments. Abusing the DLL Search Order and taking advantage of this mechanism in order for an application to load a rogue DLL instead of the legitimate one is known as DLL preloading, or (in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework) hijacking.</p>

<p>In this blog post, you will find out more about the fundamentals of DLL Search Order and how legitimate binaries can be weaponized, and introduce a tool to automate the discovery of binaries suitable for payload execution via DLL hijacking.</p>]]></description>

These simulated attacks aim to uplift our client&#39;s ability to respond to real word adversaries. We perform these assessments by firstly identifying actionable intelligence on the target, then formulate a plan of attack by mimicking the TTP&rsquo;s of the many adversaries we are actively tracking.</p>]]></description>
